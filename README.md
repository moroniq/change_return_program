\# Change Return Program ðŸ’°



This Python script calculates the change to be returned to the customer after a purchase and breaks it down into specific coin denominations used in Poland.



\## ðŸ“Œ How it works



1\. The user enters:

&nbsp;  - the cost of the purchase (in PLN, whole number)

&nbsp;  - the amount of money given (in PLN, can be decimal)

2\. The program checks:

&nbsp;  - if the amount given is less than the cost â†’ shows an error message

3\. If valid, the program:

&nbsp;  - calculates the change

&nbsp;  - determines the number of coins for each denomination:

&nbsp;    - 5 PLN, 2 PLN, 1 PLN

&nbsp;    - 50 gr, 20 gr, 10 gr, 5 gr, 2 gr, 1 gr

&nbsp;  - displays both the list of coins and the count for each denomination



\## ðŸ’¬ Example interaction



Enter a cost in PLN: 17

Enter the amount of money given in PLN: 20

\[2, 1]

The change contains 0 of 5 PLN

The change contains 1 of 2 PLN

The change contains 1 of 1 PLN

The change contains 0 of 50 groszy

The change contains 0 of 20 groszy

The change contains 0 of 10 groszy

The change contains 0 of 5 groszy

The change contains 0 of 2 groszy

The change contains 0 of 1 grosz





\## ðŸ›  Technologies used



\- Python 3

\- `while` loop for iterative calculation

\- `try`/`except` for input validation

\- Conditional statements for coin breakdown



\## ðŸ§  What this project demonstrates



\- Handling user input

\- Performing calculations using floating point numbers

\- Implementing conditional logic to cover all coin denominations

\- Presenting results in a user-friendly way
