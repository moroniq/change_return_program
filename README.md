# Change Return Program ðŸ’°

This Python script calculates the change to be returned to the customer after a purchase and breaks it down into specific coin denominations used in Poland.

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

1. The user enters:
   - the cost of the purchase (in PLN, whole number)
   - the amount of money given (in PLN, can be decimal)
2. The program checks:
   - if the amount given is less than the cost â†’ shows an error message
3. If valid, the program:
   - calculates the change
   - determines the number of coins for each denomination:
     - 5 PLN, 2 PLN, 1 PLN
     - 50 gr, 20 gr, 10 gr, 5 gr, 2 gr, 1 gr
   - displays both the list of coins and the count for each denomination

## ðŸ’¬ Example interaction

Enter a cost in PLN: 17
Enter the amount of money given in PLN: 20
Coin 2 PLN, will be given back 1.0 times.
Coin 1 PLN, will be given back 1.0 times.

## ðŸ“œ History of changes

**Commit 1** â€“ *Initial detailed version*:  
- Step-by-step `elif` structure for each coin denomination  
- Explicit counting for each coin  
- Very verbose but clear structure

**Commit 2** â€“ *Refactored shorter version*:  
- Replaced 9 `elif` blocks with a single loop over a list of coin denominations  
- Simplified logic  
- Kept the same functionality while reducing code size significantly
